# Portfolio

A portfolio website is important because it can:
- Present your professionalism and dedication to the craft better and more clearly than any CV.
- Help you stand out from the crowd, show your uniqueness, build trust, and make sure that others can actually find you.
- Provide a central location where potential employers can view your work in one place and get to know you better.
- Showcase your skills and previous work.
- Establish your authority and credibility in the industry you're working in.
