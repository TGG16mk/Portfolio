                <h2>Android Development</h2>
                <p>During my internship and industrial training at ACMEGRADE, I immersed myself in Android development, actively contributing to various projects and honing my skills in Java programming, Android Studio, and the Android SDK. Collaborating closely with fellow interns and team members, I tackled complex challenges with enthusiasm and a problem-solving mindset. I demonstrated adaptability by quickly learning new technologies and tools, such as UI/UX design principles and database integration. Additionally, I effectively communicated with team members and stakeholders, ensuring alignment with project objectives and delivering high-quality solutions. My contributions were recognized with positive feedback from mentors and peers, and I continuously sought opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in Android development. Overall, my internship experience at ACMEGRADE has equipped me with valuable practical experience and a solid foundation in Android. </p>

                <h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>As an intern at Bharat Intern Organization, I have successfully developed two websites, showcasing my skills in web development. I created a personal portfolio website and a home page for a Netflix-inspired website, both of which are available on my GitHub profile. My projects demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to build responsive and visually appealing web applications. Through this experience, I have honed my technical abilities and am eager to contribute to future web development projects.</p>
